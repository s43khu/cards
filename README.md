# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

About this:
1.Typescript is not used optimally.

2.Sometimes the card crashes to load the card and show inapropriate behavior.

3.Not optimal for all screen sizes.

Working on the backend part to make this online and adding abilities and tactical cards to make it more strategical to play but for now it's a totally luck based.
